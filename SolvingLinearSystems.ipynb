    "# Solving Linear Systems\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "In this lecture, we discuss a very common problem in science and engineering: solving linear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "## Motivating Example\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "The admission fee at a small fair is $1.50 for children and $4.00 for adults. On a certain day, 2200 people enter the fair and $5050 is collected. How many children and how many adults attended?\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "Let $x_1$ be the number of children and $x_2$ be the number of adults. Translating the word problem into math:\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x_1 + x_2 &= 2200 \\\\\n",
    "1.5x_1 + 4x_2 &= 5050\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    ".\n",
    "This is a system of two equations with two unknowns, which can be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "If we let $x$ be a vector containing $x_1$ and $x_2$, this becomes a matrix equality:\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "$$A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$$\n",
    ".\n",
    "where $A$ is the coefficient matrix and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the vector of constants.\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "## How to Solve in Code\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "Although mathematically you might write $\\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$, you should NOT compute the inverse directly in code. Computing the inverse is slower and less accurate than necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "Instead, use a dedicated linear system solver, which is both faster and more accurate. In NumPy, use `np.linalg.solve(A, b)` whenever you have an expression of the form $A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "### Example in Code\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "A = np.array([[1, 1], [1.5, 4]])\n",
    "b = np.array([2200, 5050])\n",
    "x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n",
    "print(f\"Children: {x[0]}, Adults: {x[1]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    ".\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "- Children: 1500\n",
    "- Adults: 700\n",
    ".\n",
    "You may also try the 'bad way' using the matrix inverse:\n",
    "\n",
    ".\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_bad = np.linalg.inv(A) @ b\n",
    "print(x_bad)\n",
    "```\n",
    ".\n",
    "This works for small problems, but for large systems (thousands of dimensions), you should definitely use `np.linalg.solve` for better performance and accuracy."
